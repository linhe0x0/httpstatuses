服务器已接受请求，但尚未处理或处理还没有完成。最终该请求可能会也可能不会被执行，并且可能在处理实际发生时被禁止。

在 HTTP 中不存在从异步操作重新发送状态码的功能。

The 202 response is intentionally noncommittal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The representation sent with this response ought to describe the request's current status and point to (or embed) a status monitor that can provide the user with an estimate of when the request will be fulfilled.
